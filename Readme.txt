qly files are the source code files. There are currently 3 versions; single cylinder vpa 16, single cylinder vpa 12, and dual cylinder 16. In the future there will be at least a 32 version and a twin pump version. (My hopes are that one day we only have one version that is smart enough to adapt to the different pumps)

qly files are considered live and shouldn't be released. Any released code needs to be made into a bff and copied on the NAS.
